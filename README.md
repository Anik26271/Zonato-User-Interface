🚀 Zomato User Interface Clone – Frontend Project (HTML & CSS) :
I’m excited to share my recent front-end project — a fully designed Zomato User Interface Clone built entirely using HTML and CSS.
The objective of this project was to replicate the core UI structure and visual experience of a modern food delivery platform while focusing purely on front-end fundamentals. 
I intentionally avoided using JavaScript or any CSS frameworks to strengthen my understanding of layout mechanics and styling from scratch.

🔹 Project Overview :
This project includes a structured and visually appealing homepage design inspired by Zomato, featuring:
Clean and responsive Navigation Bar
Attractive Hero Section with background and call-to-action
Location and search input UI design
Restaurant listing section with proper alignment and spacing
Food category cards with hover effects
Footer section with organized links and layout



🔹 Technical Implementation
Semantic HTML5 for proper content structure
Advanced CSS styling techniques
CSS Flexbox for layout alignment
Custom hover effects and smooth UI transitions
Organized folder and file structure for maintainability

🔹 What I Learned:
Building complex layouts without frameworks
Improving design accuracy and spacing consistency
Understanding responsive behavior using media queries
Enhancing UI replication skills with attention to detail
Writing clean and structured CSS code
This project helped me strengthen my core front-end development skills and improve my ability to convert real-world UI designs into functional web pages.
